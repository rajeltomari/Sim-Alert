+--------------------------------------------------------

This extension lets you switch "Alert modes" for a star trek ship (Red alert/Yellow alert/etc). Those alerts are then displayed in the "sim" page.

In this file, whenever you see [mod], it is the folder in which the the extension files are located. The tag [nova] denotes the path to your nova installation files.

1. INSTALLATION
================

  A: SQL DATABASE
  ---------------
Alert Status comes with a database.sql file. This file adds the necessary entries to existing tables
and creates one more tables into the nova database.
It's best that you import it directly into your mySQL database.

  B: FILES
  --------
This extension modifies the following application files:
	./applications/controllers/ajax.php
	./applications/controllers/admin.php
	./applications/controllers/sim.php

If you haven't yet modified these files, you can just upload the entire content of the ./applications/
directory in the extension into your Nova ./applications/ directory.

===
WARNING!! Uploading the folders directly will override existing files. If you've already modified those
controllers, you will need to modify these files manually.
===

    * Modified Nova Installation
    ----------------------------
If you've already modified your Nova installation (added other modifications or extensions), specially
if you've already changed the controllers
	./applications/controllers/ajax.php
	./applications/controllers/admin.php
	./applications/controllers/sim.php
you will need to manually add the functions into your controllers.

===
WARNING!!! Do not attempt to manually change code unless you know what you're doing.
           ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR FILES BEFORE YOU ADD MODIFICATIONS!!
===

1. Open [nova]/applications/controllers/ajax.php in your Nova install.
   Copy the functions inside [mod]/applications/controllers/ajax.php into the Nova version of
   the file.
   
2. Open [nova]/applications/controllers/admin.php in your Nova install.
   Copy the functions inside [mod]/applications/controllers/admin.php into the Nova version of
   the file.

3. Open [nova]/applications/controllers/sim.php in your Nova install.
   Copy the functions inside [mod]/applications/controllers/sim.php into the Nova version of
   the file.

4. Upload [mod]/applications/models/alertstatus_model.php into your [nova]/applications/models/
   folder of your Nova install.

5. Upload [mod]/applications/assets/ and all of its subfolders into your [nova]/applications/assets/
   folder of your Nova install.
   
6. Upload [mod]/applications/views/_base_override/admin/ into your [nova]/applications/views/_base_override/admin/ folder of your Nova install.

7. Upload [mod]/applications/views/_base_override/main/ into your
   [nova]/applications/views/_base_override/main/ folder of your Nova install.

    ===
    NOTICE: The files in [mod]/applications/views/_base_override/main/ (step 7) change an already existing view page in nova. If you've already changes something in that page, you will need to figure out a way to integrate the two versions.
    ===

Enjoy!
